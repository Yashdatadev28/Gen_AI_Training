The subquery is a query that appears inside another query and returns a set of rows that can be used by the outer query.\n\nThe basic syntax of a SQL subquery is as follows:\n```\nSELECT *\nFROM table_name\nWHERE column_name IN (subquery);\n```\nWhere:\n\n* `table_name` is the name of the table that contains the column that you want to filter.\n* `column_name` is the name of the column that you want to filter.\n* `subquery` is the query that is executed to retrieve the set of rows that you want to use to filter the outer query.\n\nHere are some examples of how to use a SQL subquery:\n\n**Example 1: Filtering using a subquery**\n\nSuppose you have a table `employees` with columns `id`, `name`, and `salary`, and you want to find all employees who earn more than the average salary.\n```\nSELECT *\nFROM employees\nWHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);\n```\nThis query uses a subquery to calculate the average salary, and then filters the `employees` table to only include rows where the salary is greater than the average salary.\n\n**Example 2: Using a subquery as a join**\n\nSuppose you have two tables `orders` and `customers`, and you want to find all orders that were placed by customers who live in a specific city.\n```\nSELECT *\nFROM orders\nWHERE customer_id IN (SELECT id FROM customers WHERE city = 'New York');\n```\nThis query uses a subquery to retrieve the IDs of customers who live in New York, and then joins the `orders` table with the subquery to find all orders placed by those customers.\n\n**Example 3: Using a subquery in the SELECT clause**\n\nSuppose you have a table `employees` with columns `id`, `name`, and `salary`, and you want to find the average salary of each department.\n```\nSELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary\nFROM employees\nGROUP BY department;\n```\nThis query uses a subquery to calculate the average salary for each department, and then selects the department and average salary from the result.\n\n**Common types of subqueries**\n\nThere are several types of subqueries, including:\n\n* **Scalar subquery**: A subquery that returns a single value.\n* **Table subquery**: A subquery that returns a set of rows.\n* **Correlated subquery**: A subquery that is executed for each row in the outer query.\n* **Non-correlated subquery**: A subquery that is executed once and returns a set of rows that can be used by the outer query.\n\nI hope this helps!
